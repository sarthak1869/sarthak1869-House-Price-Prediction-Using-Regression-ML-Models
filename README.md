# sarthak1869-House-Price-Prediction-Using-Regression-ML-Models
In this project on the basis of dataset which I sourced from kaggle, the prices of house were predicted on the basis of different factors

# Features
Data preprocessing and augmentation

Deep learning model (e.g., CNN)

Performance evaluation metrics

Visualization of model performance

# Usage
Clone the repository
Open the Jupyter Notebook
Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.

# Dataset
The above provided data was taken from kaggle.

# Results

We implemented various Regression models such as Linear Regression,SVR,KNN,Random Forest, Decision Treem and Polynomial Regression and among these decision tree model provided the best training r2_score of 0.92
which means it has an accuracy of 92%.
